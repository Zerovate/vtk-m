/// @brief Reduce the size of a structured data set and model the distribution of the reduced data.
///
/// This filter reduces the resolution of a `vtkm::cont::DataSet` that contains a
/// `vtkm::cont::CellSetStructured` set of cells. It behaves similarly to the
/// `vtkm::filter::entity_extraction::ExtractStructured` filter with a sample rate
/// set. However, instead of selecting samples, this filter groups blocks of data
/// and models the distribution of the data within these blocks rather than just
/// selecting a single sample from it.
///
/// Each field specified to pass in `vtkm::filter::Filter::SetFieldsToPass()` is processed and
/// the selected distribution models will be generated. Depending on the settings of the
/// suffixes for each parameter of the distribution models, all the fields might be
/// somewhat renamed.
///
/// @bug The coordinates of the output are generally bound to the mean value computed.
/// If applying this filter to a partitioned dataset, gaps will be created between the
/// blocks where mean coordinates get contracted to the center.
///
/// @bug The semantics of blocking with the cells is a bit malformed. A block of points
/// is combined to a single point, and the cells are then recreated across these new
/// points. The new cells sort of stradle over the old cells. Currently, the reduction
/// works by grouping the cells that come from the "lower-left corner" block of the new
/// cells (plus the interface cell). This means that the cell data in the blocks on the
/// opposite boundary get dropped.
